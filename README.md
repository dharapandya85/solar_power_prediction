# utilized python libraries: pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib
# reading contents of dataset(solar power generation)
# utilized matplotlib for 'Distribution of Generated Power'
The project uses Python and it’s libraries for model creation and it’s evaluation.

Libraries like :pandas, numpy,  seaborn, matplotlib  are utilized.

We plotted graph for the “distribution of generated power” by labelling “Frequency” and “Generated Power”.

Histograms generated plotting the temperature , relative humidity, mean level sea pressure, precipitation, snowfall and cloud cover.

Utilized seaborn library to the heatmap on the data.

Boxplotting is done on the dataset.

Utilized sklearn and metrices for linear regression.
We can determine the process of predicting by data collection, data preprocessing, model training, and model testing.

Data collection utilizes the dataset collected as source of input.

To clean data and normalize it, pre-processing is required.

Model training is performed by predicting the patterns and relationships between data.

Finally, determining the evaluation and accuracy of model is essential to predict the solar power output.
It is essential to advance the renewable energy and power networks to avoid carbon emissions and climate change issues.

The use and adoption of solar and wind power generation, there exist a mismatch between the power generation and load demand.

Applications and implementing machine learning models can enhance accuracy.

Linear  Regression(ML model) can determine the solar energy output with prediction.
To utilize the solar power efficiently, we use ML model to determine the prediction of output generation.

The solar energy exhibits dependency on environmental factors: temperature, wind speed, air quality , air pressure and sea level altitude , humidity , which are necessary to evaluate accuracy.

We utilized comparative performance analysis with metrics : mean absolute error, R-squared and mean square error to determine the accuracy and efficiency of linear regression.

Linear regression formulates association between two independent variable ( x and y taken as input), x denotes the external parameters required for environmental factors affecting solar power and y denotes the power energy.

We determine the linear association between parameters and generated power, which shows temperature has higher impact than humidity and air pressure on the prediction of power generation.
We have calculate the mean squared error and R square to determine how model fits the data.

We developed framework for accurate solar energy prediction with the usage of ML model.

We determined the R square score of linear regression model ,  which seems to be 0.71.

The model is not only predictive but efficient in regions with high solar power production.

Smart grid applications and smart buildings can be imagined with the integration of renewable sources in infrastructure.

We also determined the mean absolute error of the model, which is 391.790.

The model results in accurate in efficacy with specific input components in determination of solar power prediction.
